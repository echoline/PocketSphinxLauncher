PocketSphinxLauncher is a program for launching other programs and scripts,
using CMU PocketSphinx voice recognition.

It was built and has been tested on Slackware Linux 14.0

PSLauncher.sh launches the main program.  It can't really be moved.  If you want to install things more traditionally I suggest looking at the directory structure here and in /usr/local

Requirements:
	Gtk+-3.0 (built with 3.4.4)
	Alsa utilities (arecord and aplay)
	PocketSphinx and SphinxBase 0.8 (required files included)
