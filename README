See Makefiles for build configuration.

PSLauncher.sh launches the main program.  It can't really be moved.  If you want to install things more traditionally I suggest looking at the directory structure here and in /usr/local

PSTrainer.sh must also have its dependencies satisfied.  See the script for details, they are a few programs mostly from sphinxtrain.

Requirements:
	Gtk+-3.0
	Alsa utilities (arecord and aplay)
	sphinxbase, pocketsphinx, and sphinxtrain
